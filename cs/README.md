## Getting Hyper Launcher

You can get Hyper Launcher via three methods:

2. **Google Play** — Coming soon.

3. **Build from Source** — See [Building](#building) below.

---

## Building

Build the launcher (it will automatically download all required components):

```bash
./gradlew :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug
```

> Replace `./gradlew` with `.\gradlew.bat` if you are building on Windows.

- [x] mrpack/CurseForge zip import
- [ ] Modern Material 3 expressive interface
- [ ] Mod manager
- [ ] Better controller support
- [ ] Enhanced renderer compatibility
- [ ] Download manager improvements
- [ ] LTW: resolve issues with Create
- [ ] LTW: enable compute shader/image extensions

## Known Issues

- Some physical mice may have very slow mouse speed
- On Holy GL4ES, large texture atlases may be distorted (resulting in stretched/blocky textures in modpacks)
- Probably more — that's why we have a bug tracker 😉
